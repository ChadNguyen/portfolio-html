                <strong><small>Hi Coding Temple.</small></strong>
                <p>My name is Chad Nguyen, I've always been obsessed with technology and video games growing up. I worked in many different fields growing up. Moved to New York when I was 21 to start a recycling business with my best friend.

                <h1>My Interests</h1>
                <strong><small>Cryptocurrency</small></strong>
                <p>I am a true believer in cryptocurrency. Many are skeptical about it and label it "fake" money or even use the world "scam". There are more pros than cons when it comes to cryptocurrency, of course there will always be bad characters in play. No different than some current bankers and politicians we currently have. The fact that you can now send money internationally and have them recieve it in seconds is astonishing. The days of money grams and wire transfers are becoming obsolete. Lets Nigera for an example, their currency the Naira suffers from so much inflation. The average salery per month in Nigeria is about 340,000 Naira which is nearly $775 US Dollars. The Citizens are suffering from poverty and struggle with basic life needs. But Cryptocurrency was able to open a door and truly help them have access to wealth and opportunities which they never had before. Artists in Nigeria were able to make NFTs out of their own artwork and sell them for Ethereum. Imagine being a starving artist one day and the next you were able to sell an artwork for $200,000 Us dollars worth of ethereum. Thats truly life changing and a great equalizer.</p>
                <p>Lets address the "Fake" money aspect that we hear alot when discussing crypto. By default the term digital makes one automatically jump to the conclusion virtual right? Totally understandable, but is depositing your cash into the bank really any different. The money you deposit into the bank allows them to move the funds and allocate it however they like to generate profit. Thats the basic foundation of how banks are and operate. When you swipe your debit card its essentially pulling "funds" out of your bank digitally, seems alot like cryptocurrency. </p>

               <p>Always built my own Pcs from parts never bought. There is a sense of satisfaction when you do it yourself. Everything can be customed to your own personal taste, from the outside case to the Parts inside.  </p>
